pdf_pdf:

Converts a bunch of pdf files to other pdf files. This may seem
redundant, but it was done because the original pdf creator I used was
pretty inefficient in file sizes. So, I dump it out to ps and then
encode it back to pdf, which decreased the file sizes by about 50%. It
takes an argument of a list of files. Simple usage is pdf_pdf *.pdf.


png_pdf:

Converts a bunch of png files to pdf files. This was done because I
had a pile of scanned in bits that I wanted to convert to pdf's for
distribution. It takes an argument of a list of files. Simple usage is
png_pdf *.png.


ps_pdf:

Converts a bunch of ps files to pdf files. This was done because I had
a pile of printouts saved in mozilla that I wanted to convert to
pdf's for storage. It takes an argument of a list of files. Simple
usage is ps_pdf *.ps<.


wpd_sxw:

Converts a bunch of wpd files to sxw files. This was done because I
had a pile of documents done in WordPerfect some years ago that I
wanted to convert to sxw for revision and printout. It takes an
argument of a list of files. Simple usage is wpd_sxw *.wpd.
